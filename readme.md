> 💡 **TL;DR** – I'm a Spanish product builder with a business brain and an entrepreneurial heart. I co-founded Shameless Collective, a DTC clothing brand doing €10k+ in monthly sales, spent 4 years in consulting, and dedicated the past year to building full-stack AI solutions - identifying real problems, shipping fast, and getting into the hands of enterprise clients (>€90M in revenue).

## 👨‍💻 About Me

<div align="center">

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=gericke98&show_icons=false&theme=radical&hide=stars,prs,issues,contribs,repos&count_private=true&hide_title=true&hide_rank=true" alt="GitHub Stats" />

</div>

I build at the intersection of AI, entrepreneurship, and product design — driven by the need to solve real problems with speed and impact. I first turned to software to scale myself beyond what time allowed — and quickly realized it was the most powerful leverage a builder can have.

As AI reshapes the world, I've focused on becoming a truly hybrid profile: someone who can build, sell, and explain — with the belief that the best builders of this era will speak both machine and human.

## 🎯 Beyond the Code

### 🎹 Personal

<div align="center">

<img src="https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=santigericke&theme=radical" alt="GitHub Streak" />

</div>

- I play the piano, love padel, and co-run a fashion brand with two friends.
- I value speed, transparency, and high agency.
- I'm from Spain 🇪🇸 but have one foot in SF since studying at Santa Clara University.

### 🌟 Vision

I joined Go Exponential to build alongside the best in the world. I see myself in 5 years leading a startup or dev team creating tools that give humans leverage through AI. Building in the US—especially in SF—means being surrounded by energy, speed, and the mindset I want to keep for life.
