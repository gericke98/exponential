> 💡 **TL;DR** – I'm a Spanish product builder with a business brain and an entrepreneurial heart. I co-founded Shameless Collective, a DTC clothing brand doing €10k+ in monthly sales, spent 4 years in consulting, and dedicated the past year to building full-stack AI solutions - identifying real problems, shipping fast, and landing enterprise clients within multiple industries.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build at the intersection of AI, entrepreneurship, and product design — driven by the desire to solve real problems with speed and impact. I first turned to software to scale my productivity beyond time constraints, and quickly realized it's the most powerful multiplier a builder can have.

As AI reshapes the world, I've focused on becoming a truly hybrid profile: someone who can spot opportunities, build solutions, and communicate their value. I believe the best builders of this era will speak both machine and human.

### 🏆 Main Achievements

- **Shameless Collective.** Co-founded a DTC fashion brand, scaled to €10k+/month. Automated all ops — from order processing to invoicing and logistics — with custom-built tools.
- **Returns Portal.** Built a fully automated returns portal for Shameless, integrating Shopify, Correos (shipping), and Stripe. Processed 250+ returns/exchanges with highly positive user feedback.
- **Tayliq.** Built an AI-native customer support app for Shopify brands. Currently validating with early users and in talks with a €90M+ fashion brand.
- **Ring Size Detection App.** Computer vision tool to estimate ring sizes from hand photos. Built for a jewelry brand with €500k+ annual revenue (in progress).
- **Taxi Dispatch AI System.** Voice-powered dispatch platform for a Radiotaxi company — includes a driver app, geolocation tracking, and AI call handling (in progress).

## 🎯 Beyond the Code

### Personal

- 🎵 Started playing piano at 7. When I'm not coding, you'll catch me on the padel court or cheering for Real Madrid.
- 👕 Co-founded Shameless Collective with two friends a few years ago - still get a kick out of seeing strangers wearing our designs on the street.
- 🌍 Spanish at heart, but I've got a thing for Silicon Valley's ethos from my time at Santa Clara University.
- 💭 I'm all about building things that matter. No fluff, just execution. My motto? "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution"

### 🌟 Mission

My work is driven by a relentless itch to build things and solve problems. It's the force that led me to co-found a DTC brand from scratch, automate its operations, and later dive headfirst into building full-stack AI solutions. I'm obsessed with the entire process of turning an idea into something real.

Growing up in Spain, I've witnessed our incredible talent firsthand, but also seen how we don't always have the right environment to nurture it. That's what's driving me to the US — to learn from the best, build a strong network and eventually bring that knowledge back home.

My goal isn't to replicate Silicon Valley, but to help build our own version of it: A tech hub with its own Spanish identity, one where any Spanish builder with ambition has the tools and confidence to compete, and win, on the world stage.
