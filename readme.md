> üí° **TL;DR** ‚Äì I'm a Spanish product builder with a business brain and an entrepreneurial heart. I co-founded Shameless Collective, a DTC clothing brand doing ‚Ç¨10k+ in monthly sales, spent 4 years in consulting, and dedicated the past year to building full-stack AI solutions - identifying real problems, shipping fast, and landing enterprise clients (>‚Ç¨90M in revenue).

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I build at the intersection of AI, entrepreneurship, and product design ‚Äî driven by the desire to solve real problems with speed and impact. I first turned to software to scale myself beyond time constraints, and quickly realized it's the most powerful multiplier a builder can have.

As AI reshapes the world, I've focused on becoming a truly hybrid profile: someone who can spot opportunities, build solutions, and communicate their value ‚Äî believing the best builders of this era will speak both machine and human.

## üéØ Beyond the Code

### üéπ Personal

- üéµ Started playing piano at 7. When I'm not coding, you'll catch me on the padel court or cheering for Real Madrid.
- üëï Co-founded Shameless Collective with two friends a few years ago - still get a kick out of seeing strangers wearing our designs on the street.
- üåç Spanish at heart, but I've got a thing for Silicon Valley's energy from my time at Santa Clara University.
- üí≠ I'm all about building things that matter. No fluff, just execution. My motto? "Work in silence, let success make the noise."
- üéØ Morning ritual: strong cortado, clear goals, and a drive to make an impact. Whether it's coding, designing, or strategizing, I'm in it to win it.

### üåü Vision

I was born with this itch to build things and solve problems. Yeah, sometimes I work too much, but I genuinely love the process. It's not just about the end result - it's about the journey of creating something from nothing and growing in the process

Growing up in Spain, I've seen firsthand how we have incredible talent but not always the right environment to nurture it. That's why I'm heading to the US - to grow, learn, and eventually bring that knowledge back home. My dream? To create something that moves the needle in Spain and help young Spanish entrepreneurs succeed, just like Go Exponential is doing for me.
